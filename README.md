I made this out of boredom and feel free to make changes to the code. I also used an ESP32 to do this, with the oled display connected to it. Run the python script on your computer and flash the ino file to your microcontroller.
Make sure to be connected via USB

Also, you can set a custom place on your display that you want to specifically mirror to your oled.

Side note: use 230400–460800 baud for more stable video transmission - Make sure to match for the both codes.

BTW THE CODE SHOULD WORK OUT OF THE BOX!! Just flash and run the py script.
